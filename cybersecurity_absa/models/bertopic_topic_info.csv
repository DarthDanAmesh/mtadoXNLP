years ago congress took a halting step shore up u.s. defenses face unrelenting cyber threats from states criminals. this year congress faces a pivotal choice about revisiting potentially improving those defenses as nation faces expiration cybersecurity information sharing act 2015. lead-up its enactment there was a fierce debate over a recurring question how does united states harden its cybersecurity defenses working partnership public private sectors demand is clear cyberattacks are escalating both size scope sparing no one. attacks were committed against u.s. critical infrastructure private companies government systems. a very short list high-profile attacks leading up that point there were many more includes following - 2013 target data breach which affected 110

information sharing act cisa 2015 stands as a bulwark against this onslaught. while imperfect law s automated indicator sharing platform certified department homeland security 2016 has facilitated exchange millions unclassified threat indicators annually among over 200 nonfederal participants including private firms information sharing analysis centers isacs . this has directly contributed rapid responses high-profile incidents like solarwinds breach volt typhoon intrusions salt typhoon campaigns attacks that could have cascaded into widespread blackouts data exfiltration without shared

medium-sized businesses participate without fear reprisal. significantly cisa helped spur growth sector-specific isacs finance energy healthcare beyond creating a bias toward sharing that bolsters
